Review of the website
Home Page:
1. Dynamic Banner for Enrollments and Events
We recommend adding a prominent banner to showcase current enrollments and other
important nursery activities. This banner should feature an attractive image or a sliding
gallery to capture attention.
Under the banner, include a clear, clickable button (e.g., “Apply Now”) that directs visitors
straight to the application form. The banner content can be updated regularly to reflect
different announcements or events, ensuring your website stays fresh and relevant.
Example:
- Banner text: “Enrollments in Progress”
- Button: “Apply Now” → Links directly to the application form
Banner Text: “Give Your Child the Bright Start They Deserve”

▪ 2 years – 2 years 11 months
▪ 3 years – 3 years 11 months

Allow multiple selections, as some parents may choose more than one
session.

Add a checkbox for parents to confirm:
o Agreement to Terms & Conditions
o Acceptance of Privacy Policy
Include a short security assurance message stating that their data is
protected and handled securely.
Form Enhancements for Session Selection and Consent

allow multiple selections, as some parents may choose more than one option.
Additionally, include a consent section after the form with checkboxes for:
